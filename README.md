Simple command line utility to visualise the guaranteed most efficient path between tube stops.

Implements the classic A* search algorithm as published at Stanford in 1968.

Work-in-progress, currently running *python3 main.py* straight from the repository will open the pytube interactive tool.

Features in development:
    - Buildability, makepkg etc.
    - Inclusion of more datasets.
    - I/O options.
